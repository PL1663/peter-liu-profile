# Peter Liu – Personal Brand Site (Single-file)

## How to use
1) Open `index.html` directly in a browser (double-click).
2) Or deploy to GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel as a static site.

## What to edit
Inside `index.html`, search for:
- `const DATA = { ... }`  → update experience items and your content links
- Email address in the Contact section

Tip: If you paste your LinkedIn 'Experience' list into ChatGPT, I can convert it into the DATA structure for you.
